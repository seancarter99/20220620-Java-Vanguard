	 * Technical Requirements:
	 * - I should be able to calculate the winner of an election
	 * - An election with one candidate should always win regardless of votes
	 * 
	 * Edge Cases:
	 * - If there's a tie, we have a list of winners (two presidents)
	 * - What if two candidates have the same name? (Need equality comparisons)
	 * - No ballots? (Throw an exception)
	 * - No candidates? (Throw an exception)
	 * - Ballots for candidates not in election? (Flag the ballot, put in a flaggedBallot list)
